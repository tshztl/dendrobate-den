<P>Introduction</P>
<P>Prior to widespread use of the Internet, access to the information needed
for basic care and requirements for keeping Poison Arrow (Dart) Frogs was
difficult to come by. Unless you were lucky enough to befriend a breeder,
information was limited to a few picture rich but information poor books.  A
typical beginning Poison Arrow Frog enthusiast purchased whatever frog was
available and learned by trial and error, often resulting in the death of a few
frogs. Exhausted by financial or emotional losses, many potential keepers quit
the hobby. Those who persisted finally accumulated the knowledge and processes
required to successfully keep these brilliant pieces of living art. The intent
of this article is to provide the basic information required to allow a
beginning &quot;frogger&quot; to successfully keep these frogs.</P>
<P>How do I start? </P>
<P>You've started already. Read, read, read. There are several recent and
excellent books out which can give you specific requirements for a potential new
Poison Arrow Frog. If you're here, you have access to the best source of
information in the world, the Internet. There are several excellent Internet
sites and a wealth of information on the Email reflector and archive called
<A HREF="/web/19991023072541/http://www.adsi-cni.com/frogs/links.htm">FrogNet</A> (special thanks to founder Anthony Hundt).
These reflectors allow the hobbyist to pose questions to an array of experts.
Just be sure to check the archive's first. There are very few questions that
haven't been asked already and answered in the archives. </P>
<P>Setting up my first tank....</P>
<P>Fulfilling the requirements of a poison arrow frog are not difficult. They
require proper temperature, humidity and food. A typical starter tank is a 10 or
29 gallon aquarium with a fine mesh (to keep fruitflies from escaping) screen
cover. To maintain high humidity a piece of glass, plastic or even plastic wrap
can be added over the screen.  A 1-2&quot; gap at each end of the screen lid can
allow adequate airflow while maintaining good levels of humidity.</P>
<P>Since you're going to be opening and closing the lid, you will want to
attach the glass to the screen. The glass must be sized to provide the
appropriate humidity level (This will depend on the humidity of your room, how
often you spray and the type of waterfall you may install). You should see light
moisture on the glass walls of the tank. You can use silicon caulk, adhesive or
tape to bond the glass to the screen.</P><IMG

<P>At this point you have several choices. The first  choice, is to determine
whether an automatic misting system, a waterfall or just hand misting will be
used to maintain the appropriate humidity level. You may want to drill a hole in
the glass as a drain to allow excessive water to escape the tank or if you're
going for a simple setup an undrilled tank will work. Drilled tanks allow a
constant change of water in the substrate which provides a healthier environment
for the frogs. Closed tanks will rely on bacteria in the substrate, plants and
manual water changes to keep the water free of ammonia, nitrate and nitrite
which are produced by waste products and decaying food. In this type of a system
it is important to monitor these levels using standard fresh water aquarium test
kits. High levels of these substances can kill Poison Arrow Frogs. </P>
<P>The substrate for a tank should be a rounded pebble that is pH neutral
(something like quartz). A layer of 1 1/2&quot; to 2&quot; is sufficient (rinse
the stones well before using). If the system doesn't have a drain hole a thin
1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; layer of charcoal is effective as a base for a biological
filter and also to provide chemical absorption. On top of this pebble layer, a
layer of live Sphagnum, Java moss or sheet moss is used. There is still debate
about the use of moss as a substrate. Research this topic and make your own
decision. The Dendrobate Den uses locally collected sheet moss which has
produced good results. At the corner of the tank make a depression in the stone
so that a 1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; deep pool of water is available for bathing (no
towel rack required). If you're using charcoal, remove it in the pool area since
it floats. Poison Arrow Frogs are poor swimmers so avoid deep pools of water. A
drainage hole will dictate the water level. We silicon caulk a fitting through
the drainage hole and attach 3/8&quot; flexible tubing. Cover this fitting with
gravel to prevent blockage of the drainage hole by dirt. If the tank is going to
be drainless you can install a submergible small pump to provide a waterfall and
allow good water circulation through the substrate. This prevents stagnation, a
foul smelling tank and poor water quality. If you're building a waterfall from
stone, be sure the stone is also pH neutral. Silicon caulk is great to attach
these stones together, to the tank walls and to fill gaps in the rock into which
frogs may get stuck.</P><IMG
SRC="tanksid.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="240">
<P>Heating</P>
<P>The Dendrobate Den recommends the use of under the tank heat pads and a
proportional temperature controller. <A HREF="/web/19991023072541/http://www.adsi-cni.com/frogs/links.htm">Reptronics</A> is a
great source for these products and provides them at prices competitive to
ON/OFF temperature controllers. A proportional temperature controller turns the
heat pad on only slightly if the temperature has dropped slightly. If the
temperature drops farther from the desired temperature, more power is added in &quot;proportion&quot;
to the disparity in actual versus desired temperature. An ON/OFF controller does
just as its name implies, the heat pad is turned fully on or fully off. This
provides greater temperature fluctuation in the tank and is less desirable.</P>
<P>Use of submersible fish tank heaters buried in the substrate not
recommended. They provide very localized heating. At the heater, the temp may be
82 degrees and 3&quot; away it can be 75 degrees. In addition, aquarium heaters
break easily. Cheap models are known for failing in a stuck ON mode, thus
providing fried frog. A good heat source is very important, don't skimp here...</P>
<P>Planting the tank...</P>
<P>Plants maybe submerged in pots or directly planted in the stone substrate.
Pothos and Bromeliads (thornless varieties) are highly recommended. The
aesthetics of a tank can be an art form in itself. Covering other plants such as
orchids and tillandsia could fill a book. Scour the web for related info.
Remember that plants purchased from the garden center will contain
PESTICIDE/FROGICIDES so wash them thoroughly and let them age outside for a few
weeks. Finally, purchase SLOW growing plants. In these conditions a tank may
become overgrown in a few months. Though the frogs will love it, invisible
poison arrow frogs are less than desirable.</P>
<P>Lighting</P>
<P>A full spectrum light is required with UV output to help in vitamin
absorption. Both fluorescent and incandescent lights work well. The Dendrobate
Den uses incandescents for two reasons. The heat from them supplements bottom
heating and provides a more consistent temperature in the tank. Second, they can
be dimmed. This allows the use of computer controls to simulate sunrise and
sunset. Flourescents are expensive to dim. Lighting hoods can be a large expense
in setting up a tank. At the Dendrobate Den we construct lighting hoods from
rain gutter and gutter end caps. A resourceful handyman/handywoman can make a
hood for under $10. In a future article we'll provide plans for such a hood.</P>
<P>Misting Systems</P>
<P>Many froggers use simple horticultural sprayers to maintain the tank
humidity. Automated systems can run up to several hundred dollars. For a single
tank the Dendrobate Den recommends an ultrasonic humidifier. Purchase one with a
rounded mist nozzle and fit large tubing between the humidifier and the tank.
This provides a nice fog. By putting the humidifier  on a timer, automated
misting may be accomplished for under $60. If you're planning on several tanks
though, the cost of a high pressure misting system may be a worthwhile
investment. Again the adventurous can build such a system (for far less money)
from evaporative cooling nozzles and high pressure pumps. Remember that misting
systems will deposit calcium on the glass. This problem can be eliminated by
using distilled or reverse osmosis water. Regular glass cleaning with clear
vinegar is another solution. </P>
<P>A note on water</P>
<P>Use of tap water is NOT recommended. It may contain harmful metals and
chlorine. Bottled water, spring water, distilled water, rain water or reverse
osmosis water is recommended. If you must use tap water, age it for several days
first. This will allow the chlorine to dissipate. Water should also be room
temperature when used for misting. Misting is generally performed from 2-4 times
a day for a few minutes per misting.</P>
<P>My tank is built and planted, now what?</P>
<P>It's time for patience. Allowing your tank to stand for several weeks
(misted, heated and lit as if the frogs were already present)  will allow it to
stabilize both chemically and biologically. During this time it's time to build
up a stock of food for your new arrivals....</P>
<P>Food Food Food..</P>
<P>This is perhaps the biggest source of failures for a beginner. Many new
frogs simply starve to death over a prolonged period due to inconsistency in
their food supply. Now is the time to start several fruit fly cultures. 20
cultures is a good number for a pair of frogs (small frogs will require less).
There are two types of fruit flies, Hydei and Melanogaster. Hydei are larger and
are suggested for larger frogs. Melanogasters are recommended for juveniles or
smaller frogs. Wingless or flightless varieties of both exist. These are easier
prey for the frog and much easier to work with. Keeping the two types is
suggested. <A HREF="/web/19991023072541/http://www.adsi-cni.com/frogs/links.htm">Carolina Biological Supply</A> is a reliable
source for fruit flies and fruit fly media. Since fruitflies have a 4-6 week
life cycle you'll want to start several new cultures each week until you have a
constant supply. Black mold is the scourge of fruit fly keepers. If you develop
mold,  remove the cultures  and clean the containers immediately. Never start a
new culture with moldy flies.</P>
<P>There are other sources of food such as crickets (pinheads or 1 week olds).
We use <A HREF="/web/19991023072541/http://www.adsi-cni.com/frogs/links.htm">Armstrong Cricket</A> which provides consistently
sized crickets. For very small frogs or froglets, springtails are recommended.
Again Frognet is overflowing with information on alternate food sources.</P>
<P>We feed our frogs daily. Every other day is acceptable in lean periods but
any less WILL affect the health of your frogs. Before you buy a frog, be sure
you have a good food supply and a backup in case the supply fails.</P>
<P>I'm ready to purchase my first frog(s)...</P>
<P>You've arrived at the day you've been waiting for. Pat yourself on the back
for having the patience to do it right. First, check the Internet or local
reptile/amphibian shows for local breeders. The second biggest mistake a
beginner makes is to purchase wild caught frogs. If the frog is an adult, it's
probably a wild caught. Wild caught frogs have high mortality rates due to
parasite loads, shipping stress, poor temperature control during transport and
poor feeding. In addition, they can infect other frogs with these diseases. If
you can't locate a local breeder, then turn to the pet stores. Pet stores are
beginning to sell captive bred frogs, but insist that the store guarantees they
are captive bred (MOST Poison Arrow Frogs in pet stores are wild caught). Also
ask the store to feed them and only pick a frog with a good appetite. Avoid
shipping if possible and if shipping is the only alternative insist on overnight
delivery. Ask the shipper to provide adequate insulation and don't ship during
the dead of winter or heat of summer. Spring and fall are the best times to
ship. (Shameless Ad - if you're located in the northeast U.S. your best choice
for captive bred poison arrow frogs is the Dendrobate Den). </P>
<P>Now it's time to choose a species... </P>
<P>The Dendrobate Den highly recommends starting with Epipedobates Tricolor or
Dendrobates Auratus. These are beautiful, inexpensive and hardy frogs. They
breed easily and are resilient. Keeping these frogs will help you to establish a
maintenance process and verify an acceptable environment. After a year of
successfully keeping these frogs, you're ready to move on to the more
challenging species. Hone your skills on these frogs, by successfully breeding
them you will gain valuable insight and experience in their requirements. There
are few things as exciting as watching a courtship ritual, finding your first
clutch of eggs or watching a tadpole transform into a froglet.</P>
<P>Summary</P>
<P>A Poison Arrow frog enclosure can vary from extremely simple and low cost to
extremely sophisticated and high cost. Generally there is a cost versus manual
labor trade-off. If your are the type of individual who can CONSISTENTLY perform
maintenance duties a low tech, low cost tank will work fine. If you're the type
of person who has a hectic, dynamic life-style automation is the way to go. Even
so, automation does not perform all the required duties. You'll have to
religiously culture fruit flies or purchase pinhead crickets. Weekly cleaning
and maintenance duties can NOT be ignored. If you're too busy to dedicate 15
minutes a day and an hour or two a weekend every week of the year (more for a
low tech tank) then this is not the hobby for you. For the rest of us who can
devote the necessary time it is a rewarding, exciting and ever changing hobby. A
well maintained Poison Arrow Frog tank can provide hours of captivating
pleasure.</P>
