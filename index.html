<H2>The Dendrobate Den's DIY Lighting Hoods</H2>
<P>The Dendrobate Den</P>
<P>At the Dendrobate Den we are constantly adding new tanks and in the process
are in a continual struggle to keep costs down. One major cost in setup of a new
tank is in the $20 or more lighting hood. Rather than continue to purchase hoods
we decided to do it ourself and save big $ in the process. This article will
loosely describe putting how the Dendrobate Den assembles our own lighting hoods
from easy to find materials. We exclusively use incandescent lighting. We've not
looked into fluorescents, the cost may or may not justify doing it yourself,
still many of the concepts could apply to a fluorescent fixture.</P>
<P>This article is for informational purposes only, it is not a plan for
building a hood. It merely shows how we have used inexpensive materials to build
such a hood. If you decide to build your own hood do so at your own risk. We
make no warranty that any of the information contained here will work and
provide a safe end product in all circumstances.</P>
<P>Before we start let's cover the dangers in a do it yourself fixture. The
hood builder will be cutting sheet metal, playing with soldering irons and 110 V
electricity. We are proficient in all of the required skills to build such a
unit. We do not recommend attempting to build a similar unit unless you have
proficiency in these skills. Also realize that lighting hoods can get extremely
hot if improperly designed and can cause fires. The Dendrobate Den is careful to
never exceed the wattage and amperage of the components. Also we test the hood
first in a non-combustible area to be sure that it does not overheat and cause
the chance of fire. The example used here functions in our environment. If it
was installed  in a very hot area or an area providing little clearance around
it for air circulation it may overheat.</P>
<H2>The basic ingredients</H2>
<UL>
<LI> aluminum rain gutter
</LI>
<LI> gutter end caps
</LI>
<LI> ceramic bulb socket capable of accepting threaded rod
</LI>
<LI> 1/2&quot; long 3/8&quot; diameter threaded hollow threaded rod (standard
for mounting ceiling fixtures)
</LI>
<LI> screw on nut to fit threaded rod
</LI>
<LI> 6' electrical cord
</LI>
<LI> pop rivets
</LI>
<LI> 2 crimp on connectors (optional)
</LI></UL>
<H2>Tools</H2>
<UL>
<LI> electric drill
</LI>
<LI> pop rivet gun
</LI>
<LI> soldering iron (optional)
</LI>
<LI> sheet metal shears
</LI>
<LI> work gloves
</LI>
<LI> Ohm meter
</LI></UL>
<H2>Steps of assembly</H2>
<OL>
<LI> Put on work gloves (sheet metal edges can easily cause severe injury) and
cut  gutter to length
</LI>
<LI>Drill hole in gutter end cap to accept threaded rod (position hole to
center bulb in cavity)
</LI>
<LI>Attach end caps to length of gutter
</LI>
<LI>Drill 3-4 holes through gutter/end caps to accept pop rivets
</LI>
<LI>Use pop rivet gun to rivet endcaps onto gutter (sheet metal screws could be
substituted for pop rivets)
</LI>
<LI>Thread 1/2&quot; rod through endcap and install nut on outside
</LI>
<LI>Prepare two wire electrical cord ,strip back insulation 
</LI>
<LI>Feed stripped wire through threaded rod (bare ends inside fixture)
</LI>
<LI>Attach stripped wire to electrical socket using crimp on connectors or
solder [we solder]  (be sure attachment is secure. Poor attachment can cause
electrocution or fire!!!)
</LI>
<LI> Screw threaded rod into socket and tighten nut (it may be easier to remove
the female threaded mounting bracket from the socket, screw it onto rod and then
reattach to socket)
</LI>
<LI> Install bulb (less than or equal to 60 Watts)
</LI>
<LI> Measure from end cap to widest point of bulb
</LI>
<LI> Remove bulb
</LI>
<LI> Mark measured distance on gutter above bulb
</LI>
<LI> Drill several  3/8&quot; holes (minimum 6) above bulb at measured distance
for ventilation.
</LI>
<LI> Use an Ohm meter to check for shorts from hot to neutral and hot to case
and neutral to case.
</LI>
<LI> Reinstall bulb
</LI>
<LI> Plug in to test
</LI>
<LI> Let sit in an area far from any combustible (middle of driveway or garage)
for several hours and test for excessive heat. Drill more ventilation holes if
required.
</LI>
<LI> Install in a ground fault interrupted circuit and be sure adequate
clearance is maintained between the hood and any combustible material.
</LI>
<LI> Sit back and look at the $20 bill saved, that's a weeks worth of crickets
