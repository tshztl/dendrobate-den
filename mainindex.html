yet have enough to offer to the public, but if things go well we hope to have a
few later in the season.  These guys  lay massive numbers of eggs ~50 but the
survival rate of metamorphosis is very low.</B></EM></I></LI>

<LI>E. silverstonei and E. bassleri have arrived. They have survived the trip
from Germany and are doing fine. Come back soon, an entire page of photos will
soon be on line. Both frogs are about 3 months from maturity, so you can get on
our waiting list for offspring (if we're lucky) it's going to be a long one.</LI>
<LI>The Dendrobate Den is located in Harrisburg, Pa USA. We're about 2 hrs W of
Phila and 1 hr N of Baltimore. Email us for an appointment to visit.</LI></UL>
